__so decided to tackel this portion by portion__
__1st PORTION:__ setting up JSON Server as a mock backend for the /todos API -> create db.json with empty todo Array
                 -> then test routes to revise Node/npm basics + UNDERSTAND mock API's for real request.
    => JSON Server cause it provides a quick, file based API to simulate a real server without a full database like PostgreSQL which allows me to focus on CRUD without complex setup. helps me revise npm for dependencies and terminal commands from my first jest/express works.
